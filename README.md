Let’s create a map of the center of Your current geographyical location with pretty OpenStreetMap tiles. From here on, we’ll be working in JS.

By default (as we didn’t pass any options when creating the map instance), all mouse and touch interactions on the map are enabled, and it has zoom and attribution controls.

Note that the setView call also returns the map object — most Leaflet methods act like this when they don’t return an explicit value, which allows convenient jQuery-like method chaining.
